0,"A quintessential and popular Biergarten in the heart of the Munich city center, I had to stop here even knowing that everyone else who is traveling to Munich also feels the same way. I had to, and I'm so glad that I did. First off...THIS PLACE IS HUGE!  The famous HB Hofbrauhaus is an icon when it comes to drinking (and eating) establishments in Munich. One of the six breweries in the metro Munich area, its beer did not disappoint. A steady stream of customers continued to file in but nobody was walking out. In an hour the capacity of folks inside doubled. We sat down about 11am and only waited about 4-5 mins for a server to greet us. A one liter beers seem large and they are! But, cmon....you have to. And, so we did. Two 1liter original HB cold brews!  We also grabbed a Luke warm pretzel and shared an order of weisswurst (a traditional morning food for Germans) since it was before noon. The sausage was amazing. Subtle hints of seasoning in a ground veal white sausage in a firm casing. The pretzel was a combination of soft and chewy in the thicker parts with a nice brown salty crust and crunchy thin areas. And of course the beer tasted way better than our American brews. My suggestion is to definitely visit here. But get here early as from what I saw and heard, if you wait too long, you'll be standing. And beware. Certain tables have signs over them which denote them  as a ""locals"" table and they have certain rights to the table. I'm not sure that they would kick you out, but they do have ""dibs.""Prost!","May 10, 2024",4.0
1,Awesome medieval tavern vibe. Delicious sausages and refreshing beers. The waitresses will yell at you if you order something nonalcoholic lol. Grab a seat and immerse yourself!Highly recommended!,"Apr 4, 2024",5.0
2,"Visiting the Hofbräuhaus while in Munich is definitely at the top of the list for classic German beer and fare. It's bustling and warm feeling inside, like you are being welcomed home whether you're German or just a tourist!The Hofbräuhaus is famed as the world's most famous tavern. I'm sure it is ridiculously busy during Oktoberfest and other event times in Germany. We happened to go in April, and it was still busy, but not crazy at all, and we got a table to sit at and were greeted by our server right away.The decor is definitely old world and classic with heavy wooden booths and tables, as well as cream colored ceilings and columns painted with faded murals and the iconic blue and white checkered flag of Bavaria. The beer is obviously brewed by the Hofbräu state brewery, and their brews can be purchased all over the world (the iconic blue ""HB"" logo is what you look for), but that is nothing like getting it right from the source at the Hofbräuhaus!We stuck with the giant Hofbräu Original mugs (they were the size of my head!). It was surprisingly light in body and had a slight floweriness in the finish, making it super easily drinkable even though it came in the giant mugs.My travel partner and I also nibbled on a few of the food offerings, to complement our giant beers (and not to drink on an empty stomach!)I had the Beef Goulash that came in a hot cast iron skillet of sauce with perfectly cooked little bits of beef marinating inside, and accompanied by a little bread dumpling (that almost looked like mashed potatoes at first!) My friend got the giant baked pretzel, but we forgot to snap a pic - just trust me, it was wonderful.This is for sure a spot you should stop at in Munich for the history, the food, and of course, the beer!","Apr 1, 2024",5.0
3,"Came here for a beer and had a great experience! I had a .5 L of the dark beer which was great. The space is huge, there's a small stage for a band, and tons of tables but note, it's community seating. There's also a gift shop here. Stopping here for a beer is a must while in Munich. Service here was great, as our waiter was very attentive and prompt, despite the place being at capacity with visiting British soccer fans.","Apr 19, 2024",5.0
4,"A must visit when in Munich.  Part of a chain, this original location is a very festive beer hall and is a great way to experience the German drinking culture.  Get the   pretzel, pork knuckle and liter of the beer of choice and you're set!","May 28, 2024",5.0
5,Don't go for the food. Go for the experience and ambience. Service was excellent. Bring a gallon of water with you as food is really salty.,"Jun 11, 2024",3.0
6,"When I saw the big sign Hofbrauhuas, I couldn't move my legs, I got to drink a cup of beer here. The place is huge with courtyard and 3 floors, that's why we waited for a while to get service. You can sit wherever you find seats. The beer was not disappointing, I loved the atmosphere more than food, we ordered sausage platter, which is nice companion for beer. Live music was in the house to make drinking more pleasant. I feel totally relaxed and could easily spend whole day here. There are lockers for regulars to be able to lock their favorite fancy beer cups with seats.","May 19, 2024",5.0
7,"The service was great! Our hostess was dressed in traditional German attire (Dirndl) and was friendly, bonus she spoke English. She provided English menus that had traditional German dishes. The venue is a big permanent beer hall. As we left, some musicians showed up and started warming up. Parking is a bit of a challenge, but this place is worth it! Highly recommend!!","Mar 20, 2024",5.0
8,"A must stop when in Munich even if it is packed and a little touristy. We got lucky and grabbed a table just as people were leaving it. Shortly after 4 people asked to share the table. It was great, we are American and they were all from London here for the Arsenal game.","Apr 17, 2024",5.0
9,"A true classic. Definitely a must visit place, really busy but really cool. We were there Krampusnacht so that could contribute to how busy it was on a Monday. Service honestly good too, people were saying it was bad but never had an issue. Real good beer and classic kind of heavy but tasty German food. If I find myself in Munich again (I sure hope I do!) I'd go back.","Apr 21, 2024",5.0
10,"A huge german restaurant with a beautiful ceiling and wall mural art, live traditional music and huge family style tables. Unfortunately, I came here on a Saturday around 8pm and it was so packed it took about 30 minutes for my party of 6 to split up to hunt down a table. Once we did it took another 30 minutes to forceably get a servers attention to get us menus. It was like another 15 minutes to get our orders taken and an additional 45 minutes to an hour to get our food. Yup, that bad. Thankfully my party was super easy going and able to keep ourselves entertained. The pros is that the restaurant has a man walking around selling pretzels so we definitely got some to hold us up with all the waiting around for menus and our ordered food. The pretzel was good but would be much better with mustard. Good luck getting that. That took us about 20 minutes to ask a server for that after we got our pretzels. Our pretzel was almost completely devoured by then. Besides the pretzels, the food we ordered was tasty. I ordered the roast chicken, potatoes and pickled red cabbage - it was good.","Jan 1, 2024",3.0
11,Our group of 10 was able to sit upstairs where it's a bit more conducive to conversation. The beers flow nice and service is quick. Had the roast pork and crackling in a dark beer gravy which was more like a broth. Switched out the potato dumpling for spaetzle. Hubby had the pike perch. HB is somewhere every visitor should experience.,"Apr 10, 2024",3.0
12,"We got off our train in Munich, and my husband dragged us to Hofbrauhaus - which turned out to be his mothership. I saw a genuine smile on him for the first time in two weeks. It was an upbeat place that was beautiful inside. It's huge! We sat inside just a couple of tables from the polka band, and it was really fun. I can imagine this place could get super loud when packed, but it wasn't bad when we were right when they opened at 11 am. He had a couple of beers and discovered beer fills him up much faster than when he was 23. He wished he'd tried a few smaller beers rather than go for one big one that immediately filled him up. Our daughter had the strawberries and cream, which I'm sure was good, but I can't vouch for it since she wouldn't let me get a forkful. And while the radish/chive/bread sounds rather dull, I loved it. Dense bread with a white creamy butter and chives was tastier than you might guess. I also love all the radish dishes in this country; they don't have the spicy flavor we are used to in the States. Of course, we also had pretzels, which are harder and crunchier than a Wetzel's Pretzel of the same size. Try both mustards that come with it, I thought the sweet one was flavorful even though I'm usually picky about mustards.","Jun 10, 2024",5.0
13,"We were so excited to eat at the infamous Hofbrauhaus! We made a reservation, and got a nice little table on the 2nd floor. They had live music! Every part of the experience was great. It's a must-see spot for great food and even better beer. The first floor is the traditional open seating style, so it was fun to see it busy and loud! Great gift shop too.","Mar 21, 2024",4.0
14,"If you're looking to feel like you're at Oktoberfest when you either A) don't want to go to Oktoberfest or B) aren't in Munich during Oktoberfest, this is probably your best bet. This location is huge and there is seating on multiple levels. We stuck to the first floor because we liked the vibe, but it's not for everyone. Apparently you can find quieter tables upstairs, but just go in knowing that it will probably be crowded and energetic on the first floor.After you find a spot, you wait for a server to come by to take your meal order. If you'd like a pretzel or a cookie, you call over one of the people walking around with them and pay them cash. As a foreigner to Germany, I felt the food was decent. Someone from Germany might feel this is likened to Applebee's or something, but I didn't take issue with any of the dishes. We ordered a pretzel, a half chicken, the sausage plate, and the Spätzle. While the Spätzle and sausages were okay, the chicken was really tasty and I enjoyed this the most. It was so tender and not dry whatsoever, and although it wasn't heavily seasoned, it was well-cooked. The pretzel was also fine, but you can definitely get a better one elsewhere. We started off the trip slow with half-liters of beer here, but like many places in Munich, you have the option of a half or a whole liter. A band plays somewhere near the middle of the room, so pay attention to where you sit if you don't like loud sounds near your head.","Oct 22, 2023",4.0
15,"Hofbräuhaus in Munich, Germany, is a quintessential Bavarian experience that transports you to the heart of traditional German hospitality - it left me with a hearty dose of good food, lively vibes, and an overall positive impression.The star of the show was undoubtedly the roast pork with crackling, a dish that captured the essence of Bavarian culinary excellence. The pork was succulent, and the crackling added a delightful crunch that elevated the experience. Paired with authentic German potato dumpling, it was a comforting and satisfying dish that showcased the rich flavors of Bavarian cuisine.The addition of a bread basket was a pleasant touch, offering an assortment of freshly baked bread that complemented the hearty main course. Additionally, indulging in a pretzel from a roving vendor added an element of fun to the dining experience. The pretzel, with its golden crust and soft interior, was the perfect accompaniment to the lively atmosphere.Speaking of atmosphere, the lively ambiance at Hofbräuhaus is truly something to be celebrated. Live music echoed through the halls, creating a festive atmosphere that beckoned guests to join in the merriment. The communal seating and convivial spirit of the place make it an ideal spot for socializing and immersing oneself in Bavarian culture.The service, while friendly, was a bit on the slower side, and securing a table can be a challenge during peak hours. However, these are minor considerations given the overall charm of the establishment.In conclusion, Hofbräuhaus is a must-visit for those seeking an authentic Bavarian dining experience in Munich. The flavors, atmosphere, and cultural immersion make it a memorable destination - recommend it to anyone looking for a lively taste of traditional German hospitality. Prost!","Dec 23, 2023",4.0
16,"The beers are refreshing here, full to the brim and in tall, iced glasses. Ordered the HB Bavarian platter with a bread basket and it was enough for lunch. The tables are communal style so you just walk in and sit where you want. The service was a bit slow since they seemed short staffed and were rushing around tables. The entertainment at lunchtime was moderate and muted. The Las Vegas Haufbrahaus was more lively with its passionate band, various beer contests, getting the crowd to sing beer songs, a woman selling shots and spankings, and variety of entertainment acts every week.","Mar 16, 2024",3.0
17,"Obviously a must go on everyone's Munich itinerary. Huge beer hall with tons of seating. If it happens to be busy you just look around and find a spot at any table. Servers are good and will find you. They take both cash and credit. Went during Oktoberfest time, so was likely more busy then usual. Found a spot right away. Ordered kasespatzle and it was very good. Beer was good. Very lively environment inside with live music. They also have a beer garden. Few different gift shops within the place with all the merch you could want from a beer hall. This place has lots of history and was involved in a lot of historical events. Would be nice to read a little on the history before you go.","Oct 15, 2023",5.0
18,"I can't speak for the food, because I was here to drink during Oktoberfest. However, a lot of people around me were eating and the food looked fantastic! But, can you really go wrong with meat and potatoes? According to my Polish friend, who has been to Oktoberfest more times than he can count, this is his very favorite place to have beers in the city. I didn't have anything to compare it to, but I was very impressed at how good the service was, considering how packed it was the night we were there. Beers came immediatley. After a long day of flying in from the west coast of the states and walking 10 blocks from our hotel - this place and the giant beers hit the spot.","Nov 29, 2023",5.0
19,"The hype is real and it sure lives up to it. If you're from the States like me don't think you'll get the table service your used to. This place is so darn busy these servers ain't got time for the jaw jackin or typical niceties you're used to. I respect that and you should too dude/dudet! The beer is amazing here. Just think for a second on why they've been here for so long, but don't think too much because you'll miss the server coming by and you'll need to flag em down and order. Also be sure to order some roast chicken. It's like a rotisserie chicken but 10x better. It'll soak up all the alcohol. Not sure if it's just because I came here for Oktoberfest but they had a live band playing your traditional Bavarian bangers. Puts the vibe all together for one great Beer hall experience. Hoping to come back next year and find the kind strange gentleman who shared our table with a warm pretzel and a smile.","Sep 21, 2023",5.0
20,"If you come to Munich, and you like beer, then this is a ""must stop"", simply for the history, if not the atmosphere.In spite of what some may opine, their beer is very good by most any standard, but among regional German breweries they face very stiff competition.The beer hall is loud and touristy, but if you're reading this, you are likely a tourist. So go enjoy yourself. As for comments on cash only, they took my card this afternoon, no problem. Enjoy. Cheers!RS","Sep 18, 2023",3.0
21,"Had to check out a Munich staple. I was told this place had been around since the 1400's. You can do tours of the old brewery if you book in advance. The location is extremely neat and spacious. Great for groups, although the service is relatively spotty. It can take some time to get served. I highly recommend you stop by for a beer at least, because the venue is beautiful and very unique. It's like stepping back in the past!","Jan 11, 2024",4.0

23,it's a must do when visiting Munich! no reservations are needed when in smaller groups and they do accept credit cards. The giant pretzel was fantastic and you get that from the girls that come around the tables. Now for those westerners you'll have to understand and be patient when ordering unlike in America people take their time here so enjoy the atmosphere. They are pretty good at getting your beer order in. Keep in mind that this is a communal table so you could be sitting with other people so enjoy and make friends.

24,"Everyone says, ""You have to go to this place!"" And they're right.This is the largest indoor pub in the world (might not technically be true, but it's huge : )I'm going to give you a very simple review and you can look at my pictures.--the ambiance (5+/5) is out of this world! Long tables, seating as many as a dozen (or more), people cheering, the umpa band playing. So much fun.--the service (4/5) is not bad, considering the mass quantities of people.--the food (2/5). Don't go for the food. I had the veal sausage (2/5), a pretzel (2/5), and apple streusel (3/5).--the beer (4/5) was good.

27,"Food 4Service 2Ambiance 5This was so much fun!I finally understood why our beer halls in Milwaukee are the way they are lol. We were there on Wednesday night, and the place was packed to the brim full. You have to find your own seating, and feel free to sit next to other people, since all tables are shared. Getting a table is like war though. not knowing the rules, it took us a while to find out that we had to find our own seats, but after literally standing in front of a server to ask for help, we were told to seat anywhere. After that it was a matter of finding people who were leaving, which we did, but just as we were seating down after a party got up, this one server came barreling down and yelled at us not to sit there. And then, he waved over 4 girls and told them to sit down before us. What's up with selectively finding seats for some customers (coincidentally, all 4 of them looking single in their 20's)?Being swept up in the whole atmosphere, we let that go and just sat down next to the girls. Our table was big enough to sit 8. Being in Germany, I'm wary of making this joke from Frasier, but, have you heard of soup Nazi? Well, our server was a beer Nazi. He refused to serve beers smaller than a liter per person. We were totally fine with that lol, but the 4 girls beside us were all flabbergasted (though still dutifully ordered their 4 liter beers, and then drank maybe about a quarter of each cup before leaving). Our server also acted like he spoke no English, and kept saying something about why he can't bring us smaller beers in German. But when the time came for us to pay our bill, his English improved significantly, started asking us small questions like where we were from all of a sudden, smiled, and told us that tip wasn't included in the bill. And then stay and watch you as you make the payment. The menu says a pretzel is 1.9euros, but they don't sell it. You have to buy it separately from the ""bread girl/guy"" who comes around with the pretzels in a basket. And they charge 4.2euros. They will also rob you of your change, so count your coins. Or not. Just be a tourist and enjoy the moment and let them have their fun. We walked in knowing it was a tourist trap, as did the 1,000 (or 2) other patrons inside, but it was still all fun and games. The food was actually quite good, the live music was fun, and the atmosphere was bustling with energy. You gotta go at least once!Oh, the food:pretzel - good. But I can proudly say, that the pretzels at beer gardens here in Milwaukee actually top theirs!obazda (cheese spread for the pretzel) - good. Again, Milwaukee, though...four pieces of pork sausage - good, but we had better sausage at every other corner in Germany. Including Norma's. Sauerkraut was delicious! I never liked sauerkraut much, until this visit to Germany. Roasted knuckle of pork - I had this 3 times in Germany, and this one was comparable to the other 2 places. I learned that I love this dish. Beef goulash - it was like tomato soup with huge chunks of steak inside. Overall, I wouldn't go here for a gourmet meal, but for the energy and the pure experience. It's just fun! And maybe if you're single, you can find a table with a bunch of other single and available others to get to know better.","Jun 11, 2023",5.0
28,"Avoid Sundays... we had such a great time the other day that we came back to Hofbrauhaus on Sunday. What a mistake. It seems like the backup waiters work Sundays. They must draw the short straw. We had M. Sataric today and he was terrible. I know it was only his 4th day, but he mixed up a lot of orders: beers, food, you name it. He brought the wrong thing or nothing at all. And he argued about everything with us... and the table next to us. He also kept disappearing for lengthy periods. It was not crowded, yet service was very slow.","May 26, 2024",3.0
29,"This is one of the few places I've ever been that truly lives up to the hype. It's definitely a must see in Munich, plus the food and drinks are excellent and the service is top notch. Be sure to check out the outdoor beer garden for the full experience. We had a sausage platter, pretzels, and beer which is basically the Bavarian trifecta.","May 25, 2024",5.0
30,"I would say this place is a must. They have a MASSIVE beer hall with multiple levels, indoor, and outdoor seating. It is first come first serve and very busy. The beer is cold and delicious. For my main dish, I ordered the goulash and it was one of the best dishes I have had yet during my time in Germany. The service was okay as they are so busy. I would recommend ordering a large beer while you wait to order your food or to prepare to order everything ASAP to prevent spending too much time there. I came during the summer and it was very hot inside the beer hall, but outside was perfect.","Jun 30, 2023",4.0

The chicken was succulent and well seasoned. The homemade potato salad was delicious as well. It had a nice tang to it. For drinks, I ordered a liter of the Munchner Weisse (wheat beer). It was crisp, cold, and awesome.One of my friends order the same meal and she love it as well. My wife ordered the (Roast pork with crackling - fresh from the oven -served with homemade dark beer gravy and a potato dumpling)* My wife said she loved the pork immensely. The dumpling was just ok, it wasn't her favorite. Another friend ordered the Four pieces of pork sausage - served with mustard and sauerkraut.

All of the food was actually really delicious.The only thing I was not a fan of was the pretzel. They had girls walking around selling very large pretzels and they were hard and dry. Not what I expected. And they did not have the sweet mustard that we are used to getting at Hofbrauhaus in the US. They also had a polka style band that played music.The energy is very loud and upbeat. It is a fun time. This is best for groups but not required. Anyone can have a fantastic time here.

33,"This is a must visit place. The history itself is impressive. Their food is classic and beer is good. Please understand that this place gets extremely busy and crowded very fast so finding a table can be challenging at times. Your best bet is to walk around and if you find reserved tables, check the time of the reservation. If the reservation is within two or three hours, take it. Bring your patience, the waiters work hard to keep the food and drinks going. If the pretzel lady is walking around, know that she only accepts cash. Do get their big pretzel though, they are fresh out of the oven and delicious. Remember that they follow the beer purity law so the beer might be different from what you're accustomed to from whatever country you're from. Their dark beer is not as dark as a porter or stout but it is good nonetheless. We had an excellent dinner. Everything was hot and delicious. Our waiter was courteous and did an excellent job. Also know that if you're paying with card, you'll have to go with the waiter to pay for your food. They don't bring you a bill unless you're paying with cash. Also remember to ask if the service fee is included in the bill. That's basically the tip. However, from what I understand, most if not all restaurants pay a living wage so tips are not required but certainly appreciated if good service was received","Dec 27, 2023",5.0

However, our server was very short with us and clearly needing to go home for the day. We told her we were waiting for family to show up as we were ahead of them and she didn't think about what we told her and the table was split between two servers. That's not the biggest problem, our food didn't show up until those who came after us were almost done with their food! These were my first sausages of this trip and I must repeat this meal elsewhere because they were incredibly lackluster. It was nice to visit the location, experience this history, but this was surely a one and done for us.","Dec 14, 2023",3.0
35,"Short review: Good food, Good Beer, quintessential German experience? NO. Too many tourists - granted I'm one of them.Full review: Do not come here if you're timid you'll never get a table. It's literally a madhouse, you have to hunt for your table then pounce on one as soon as the butt cheeks clear 2 inches from the chairs. The food is good especially the kasespaetzle, the caramelized cheese takes it up a notch. Also the  four pork sausage with sauerkraut, (thats not too sour) very earthy savory, not as sweet as the other sausages I've had here. We also liked the half roasted chicken. You can skip the pretzels and suckling pig.The Hofbrauhaus original beer goes down smooth with substance -  very good actually. And the same for the radler - just the right amount of sweetness with no aftertaste. Service despite the busyness of the place wasn't bad.","May 23, 2023",4.0
36,We were a party of five and ordered different dishes and all were on the salty side.(I guess you will drink more beer).  With one exception the wurst was not salty.  The beers were okay following the purity laws established in the 1500's but not my favorite from other breweries.Service was great had good server who interacted with us; an exception in Germany.We had a reservation and were seated on the second floor in the booth with the rendition of Mozart on the wall.The ambiance was great; reflecting on the history of this place and the ompah band playing live. In short come for the history and ambiance.,"Dec 17, 2023",3.0

38,"It's a tourist trap.  You know it. They know it. Everyone knows it.  Walk in and you'll be guided to a table and sharing a large communal bench with groups from around the world.  My small group met some Australians and then two Brits living in the Cayman islands.  The hall was loud and the band played typical Bavarian music.  It's the closest you can come to Octoberfest when it's not Octoberfest.  The food is 30-50% more expensive than other places in the marienplatz.  The beer is also.  But that's what you pay for when you get here.  Just like anywhere in Germany, tipping is not required but here they will ask you for one because you're a foreigner.  As one of the Brits told me.  It might be a tourist trap, but when you're in Munich you have to spend one night at the hofbrauhaus.   I would definitely agree.  It's worth a visit!","Feb 9, 2023",4.0

The atmosphere is that of Oktoberfest with tons of beer HB of course and Bavarian feats and live music.

47,"Okay for beer, but it's a bit like a Chuckee Cheese for tourists - meaning it's gimmicky as hell, overcrowded, sticky floors, loud and with a band playing every few minutes, and service is fast as lightning in that the staff is overextended. No clear vegan options. A pretzel man comes by with offerings available for cash euros. The spot dates back to the 16th century so the architecture is gorgeous though there are disturbing speciesist, classist, and violent murals adorning the walls that I wish would be updated to reflect new, modern Germany. It's Bavarian state government owned which I think is to blame for the history washing - turns out this place is the beer hall of the Hitler beer hall speech. It would be really great if this was made clear to guests in a way that was respectful to the victims of the Nazi party and honored them rather than hiding this to maintain a joyful atmosphere. We felt pretty gross when we found out and wished there had been a spot carved out to pay respects to those murdered and acknowledge the atrocities. And perhaps some of the earnings can be donated to concentration camp survivors and families, or museums that maintain their stories and legacies. Context: Adolf Hitler announced the official program of the Nazi Party to a meeting of around 2,000 people at the Hofbräuhaus on 24 February 1920. At the time, he was propaganda chief of the party whilst the organisation was still relatively small. On 29 July 1921, he was elected Führer of the Nazi Party during a meeting at the Hofbräuhaus am Platzl.","Jun 23, 2023",2.0

We came here for lunch on a Thursday and it was nearly at capacity, and this restaurant is huge!You seat yourself at a shared picnic table; be careful not to sit in reserved spots. The live Oompah band was in full swing, but nearly drowned out by the massive chatter from the many patrons.They have several beers to choose from and, of course, you have to get the 1 Litre stein!

I got up twice to ask the hostess and the server for help and they kept telling me that they are busy and they will take my order soon.

The good news is we did make it while on a small private city tour, walked right in. This was late afternoon. There is nothing better that a cold beer, well maybe two. The food was also good.

The atmosphere is festive and wide eyed tourists sit alongside merry local gentlemen sipping their mugs of beer! The oompah band, singing and jovial laughter added to the fun. The food was suprisingly decent.  My husband had beer and wurst (of course) and I had a glass of Gruner Veltliner wine and a green salad which was better than expected. The fresh pretzel was delicious! Last of all, the Hofbrauhaus has an extensive souvenir shop with signature blue and white items at all different price points.

55,"If you visit Munich, this is a MUST (touristy) stop for a Beer stein and food at the Hofbrau Haus!  A world renowned place is busy ALL the time, and generally 1st come seating; and in German style, you may be sharing part of your table with others depending how many friends you bring! But everyone is friendly, the mood is festive and the brews and eats are excellent. So even if you come on your own, you'll make lots of new friends at a table!  Be patient, service timing is efficient but not fastest, but allows you time to soak in the experience!  Overall, a 4.5+ rating for me based on ambience, fun crowd, good beers, friendly service and authentic food, especially the Pork options, yum!  Expect to pay $15-18euro for a meal plate, but the quantity is shareable for 2 if modest appetites.  Of course, apps, famous pretzels, and more are available, so you won't go hungry or thirsty!Tried the special cheese dip spread for starter; chilled and mildly tasty went well on bread or a pretzel.  Plenty to share and compliments the beer for sure!  The homemade Potato soup is also flavorful and creamy.Ordered 3 dinner types. My personal fave was the Roast Pork with Crackling;  tender sliced and slow roasted pork had a crispy topping, served with homemade beer gravy and potato dumpling - delicious comfort fare!  Also tried the Suckling Pig shank which was super tender, tasted like traditional Ham; served with parsley potatoes atop sauerkraut and side horseradish.  Finally, the whole roasted Knuckle of Pork was their signature item; wonderful and filling, but you had to manage eating meat off the bone, thus I liked first choice best. You won't go wrong with any food selection here, just bring your appetites!Beer (dark, light) steins by the liter (33oz) are typical, but you can get 1/2L and yes they offer limited wine alternatives for non-brew fans.This landmark spot was worth the visit, check it out in Munich, PROST!

However it was quite disappointing. We sat ourselves and waited for awhile before a waiter rushed by and demanded ""0.5l, 1l""?? While taking orders from our table and another one at the same time.

59,"Having been to Germany before, specifically to Hofbrau in Munich, I had to return.  For those that don't know what the experience is like in a German Beer Hall, it's amazing but daunting at first.  You share tables with anyone that fits at it. Typically four or five people to a side. So don't get weirded out that a group of people you don't know sat with you or the only place to sit is with people you don't know, that is all part of the experience.  Hofbrau is a busy place. Like super busy. You will find seating, but you have to be ready for the motion and energy in there.  There is constant movement, great music, toasting, and a good high energy.  The food is classic Bavarian fare. Europe doesn't over sugar everything like we do in America, but it makes it taste better because you can't mask flavors with sugar.  We want during Oktoberfest, so there was a lot of the same items across the board, probably for ease of making large quantities.  All in, the food and beer in Munich is world class. Ok, on to the food.  We had pork knuckle, German meatloaf, and Spätzle. The pork knuckle was amazing. It comes out on two bones so you have to work at it to get the meat off, but each bite was worth it. The potato dumpling that came with it was an unexpected consistency. It was really good, just didn't expect it to have an actual dumpling consistency. The meatloaf was good, but man did it get amazing when I put the mustard on it that came with it.  It looked like bologna, but it was just a really flavorful meatloaf.  The breading or crust on the outside of it added to the flavor and experience as a whole.  Spätzle was new to us, but it was love at first bite.  It's like a Mac and cheese, but the ""noodles"" are more like a dough so they taste fantastic with whatever is put on them.  We had multiple versions on our trip and were never disappointed. If you're in Munich, it's in your best interest to hit up Marienplatz for the Glockenspiel, then mosey around the corner to this amazing brew house. Hofbrau never disappoints.","Sep 29, 2022",5.0

The food was ok, very hot plates with room temperature food. Also watch where you're walking, the waiters/waitresses will nearly knock you out with their trays","Dec 12, 2023",3.0
61,"I decided not to eat here last time I was in Germany with my mother but this time I was here with my fiancee on a business trip with him, so we joined several of his co-workers for dinner here one night. The inside is beautiful and they are almost always crowded.  It has about three levels which I didn't realize before, so we ended up eating upstairs and there was plenty of seating. The menu is loaded with typical Bavarian dishes. So think meat, potatoes, pretzels, more meat, and carbs, carbs, carbs.  LOL. I don't drink alcohol so I didn't try that - but we did order a starter for the table of some typical items which consisted of pretzels, bread, meat, cheese, and some mixture of cheese and butter and eggs like a spread that was absolutely delicious (and I'm sure not healthy at all but hey, it's vacation).  I chose the beef goulash served with a side of spaetzle and it was not good.  My fiancee had ordered goulash while we were in Salzburg for my birthday a few days prior and it was delicious and flavorful but this was nothing like that.  Tasted like it came out of a can and the spaetzle was rubbery and flavorless.  My fiancee ordered pork knuckle and I tasted it, it was pretty decent but super fatty and I was just pretty much grossed out overall by the dishes. Fortunately, I ordered a side salad that was pretty good and it was my savior for the meal. I ordered the apple strudel as well and didn't enjoy it.  It was just not high quality. We had a good time and service was very good and, at the end, a huge party of locals came upstairs and started playing their own instruments to rival the rivalry that happens on the first floor, so that was pretty cool. We stayed 9 days in Munich so I was pretty familiar with the city and local area by the time we left having walked around for days and dined all over the place for three different meals a day. It's an experience to enjoy a meal and a few beers in this historic building established by the kings of Bavaria that dates back hundreds and hundreds of years.  I googled the hofbrauhaus after we ate here and was impressed with everything I discovered, so it's worth a visit, but the food was not at all as good as you can find in the rest of Munich.  I'd recommend you come for a drink, enjoy the music, and dine somewhere else!","May 18, 2022",3.0

We are glad we went and experienced this famous beer hall but have no reason to visit again. The younger me might have completely loved the atmosphere 10+ years ago but in our old age, we learned that finding a small, local beer hall to explore was more our speed. The Hofbrauhaus is massive, loud, crowded, and full of beer. The tables are shared by multiple parties, people are cramped in, and trying to walk through the aisles to tables is an adventure. The servers are constantly scrambling and carrying handfuls of mugs - they are also not the friendliest or helpful for this reason.

Then your server comes and will give you the menu to look over and will come back for your order.  You have to order the large beer because that's what they are known for.  While your are waiting for your beer a gal comes around and sells bread and pretzels from her basket.  The pretzels are legit and cost about 5euros.  They only take cash.  The restaurant itself takes credit card.   The food is decent pricing and our group tried a lot of dishes on the menu. Downside is that it's pretty salty but I figure it's because they want you to drink more beer lol.The ambiance is definitely why you go there.

We visit each time we're in Munich sometimes multiple times a trip because the atmosphere cannot be replicated. They are checking vaccine status and require masks when walking around. Once you're given the OK you walk around to find a table. Completely seat yourself and you often times have to sit at tables with other parties because the tables are large and can accommodate multiple groups. Definitely not the time to be shy! Step up and get in there or you won't find a table. The servers are very busy and don't come around super often. Try to have your order ready as soon as possible. They have menus in MANY different languages, so don't hesitate to ask if you're having difficulty. The menu is definitely smaller with fewer offerings than was was offered pre-Covid. For instance I was in LOVE with the roast fest chicken and unfortunately that is no longer on the menu. We ordered the Nuremberg sausages with sauerkraut and the potato soup. The soup was absolutely delicious! Creamy and warm. Perfect for a winters night. We also ordered several liters of beer and that beer is truly the best. You can order the weisse beer in a liter even though the menu does not list it out. They accept cash and card, but you have to walk with your server to the pay station if you want to pay with card. They often have live music on a little stage. Very traditional German fest music which makes the space even more lively and entertaining! Hofbräuhaus is a must visit during your stay in Munich!

Looking around, all the tables are the same size and saw some people with 2-3 sitting at the same ones we sat at. I was nearly annoyed and felt like we were not welcomed. My wife was ready to just leave and annoyed I asked a waiter what is their definition of a small table because we were told we were not welcomed to sit at the longer ones. He gestured to sit at his area and it's ok to sit at the big table. Obviously he was way more friendly and attentive. He took our orders and served our drinks and food rather quickly. Because of his willingness, I left a nice tip for him. Overall, a positive experience despite the first encounter with the waitress. Would I come back? Perhaps, but there are other places to try too.

If we hadn't done the Third Reich Tour I'm not sure we would have come here (Hitler would give speeches here and up until the early 2000's the SS was still on the ceilings). We ordered the Spaetzle (no photo) pork sausage and sauerkraut and of course beer (light and dark). All were fine. There were vendors walking around selling giant pretzels and chocolate cookies (paid separately and cash only).

92,"People have called this a tourist trap, but I only think that term applies to places that get unjustified hype. In our opinion, this place deserves the hype. There's a beer for everyone. I personally don't like the after taste of most beers, so I went with the radler, which is mixed with lemonade. It was so good! I got the pork knuckle because it's the specialty of the area, and it didn't disappoint. Tender and flavorful. Definitely recommend trying it! The vibes were just so fun, and it really made for the best last day in Munich for us. Open seating and shared seating, meaning you find open seats and sit at a table with strangers. I usually wouldn't be a fan of this, but when traveling it makes it fun because it feels like you have to talk to the people at your table. So we got to meet new people and ask them about their beer and food choices. There was a live band when we were there, which just brought it all together. 10/10 we will definitely come back if we ever find ourselves back in Munich!","Nov 10, 2023",5.0

We ordered the white sausage as a side, The mustard that's served with the sausage was prime. 4 stars due to the service being awfully slow.

101,An awesome beer hall that gets really crowded and loud but the food and drink more than make up for it. If you can (or are willing to try) speak German with your waiters and you will get better service I think. Don't be a jerk - that's how you get poor service. The Schweinshaxe is the best item here although the roast chicken is also very good. Love their dumplings. The Dunkle beer is my favorite but the Weiße is quite nice too. Pretzels were a bit dry and you have to ask for mustard - they don't just bring it with the pretzel. The desserts are just ok but you don't really expect Apfelstrudel to be amazing at a beer hall right?My youngest kid got a little toy pack with anime stickers at the end from the waiter because it was Christmas - so sweet of them!Highly recommend,"Dec 25, 2022",5.0

The two of us visited Hofbräuhaus on the whim in the evening with no reservations. This place is loud with music, laughter, and chatter. Our waiter gave us more than enough time to figure out what we wanted to drink and eat. He also gave us the run down on what's what on the menu since he originally handed us a German menu. The food arrived quick and piping hot. The portions are quite big so with a few pints of beer and a platter full of meat (I had their grilled sausages platter and schnitzel platter) and you're destined to go home full, bloated, and sleepy.

It's very hard to get a good table. Plant to possibly wait a bit. I didn't get to sit in the main hall but we were able yo walk through it.

They spoke both German and English for our group for people who did not understand German. We had a great time and the food was ok. Seeing it a big tourist spot you can always find better at a mom and pop place but it still was not bad. Of course the beer is great and reasonably priced.

Which is insane because this place is 3 gigantic floors of tables & chairs. But on the 25th, it was not a mad house. It was packed, but there was still plenty of room for us to sit and grab a giant beer. There was a live band playing when we walked in and they were great! Traditional German beer hall music. It was like we walked into a movie. There was this one really drunk, really big customer trying to be the maestro for the band, it was pretty hilarious.  A few days later my husband & I decided to go back for another beer before dinner out, but this time it was the aforementioned mad house.

If you can, try to make reservations, because this is one of the most popular places to drink in town, especially during Oktoberfest.Unfortunately, I didn't take too many pictures here, but my friends and I enjoyed a mass (~34 oz.) of beer each and I ordered spaetzle for dinner.

I conceded the hotel dinner if we could eat here. I'm so glad we did!First off, there are 2 dining areas. There is a more formal, relaxed area on the 2nd floor. Then there is the beer hall area - which is where we were headed. You basically have to stalk the room for a place to sit and then you are going to be sitting with strangers (unless you have 6-8 people). It is complete chaos and craziness and I loved every minute. After getting our server's attention, we ordered beer and food. I opted for the Radler liter and roast beef. The beer was delicious and the food was amazing. I loved the sauce on the roast beef. There is a band that plays and a toasting song that the locals sing along with. There is also a souvenir shop to visit as well.

I could see why, but also if you have any kind of social anxiety or get claustrophobic in a crowd I highly recommend not coming here.I finagled my way into a table shared with many others. A nice non-English speaking German gentleman assisted me in getting a very large...nay, gigantic vat of beer. Apparently there is only one size. As I two-handedly drank my liter of beer, I patiently awaited my food (schnitzel, a crowd favorite and house specialty) and listened to the traditional music played by a band of men donning lederhosen.

Same applied to the liver soup (Rinderbrühe) as it was really salty.Service was slow and know what you want to order as servers are not very patient. Noticed that we didn't even get bread that a group of five got next to us.

138,"3.5 starsIt checked a box, coming here. Having just gone through the brewery tour outside of Munich the day before, it seemed only natural that we'd stop by the restaurant for food and beer.We arrived at about 11:30 am on a Friday, so restaurant wasn't overly crowded. We did walk towards the back of the building to find a spot to sit, though. Menus are laid out on the tables, and we asked the first person who stopped by for English versions. (I did request English menus in my choppy German, which I think entertained the guy).For my main, I went with the Bierbratl (crisp roasted pork belly with gravy, sauerkraut and a bread dumpling). My husband went with the roast pork with crackling (which came with a potato dumpling and gravy). For our beer choices, I went with a liter of the Winter Special Dopplebock. My husband got a liter of the Hofbräu Original. I'm pretty sure I enjoyed my beer more than my husband. The Dopplebock had a good roasted flavor that helped mask the slight bite. My husband didn't like the Original - it was too light for him, but he had no problem finishing it off.The food was good and very filling. It was also crazy salty. I'm pretty sure that's a German strategy - salty food makes people thirsty, thirsty people drink beer. Anyway - the pork slices had a nice, crispy crust to the skin. The sauerkraut was tangy and the gravy was meaty (and salty). I couldn't do much with the dumpling - it was way too dense and reminded me of my mother-in-law's stuffing.We also flagged down one of the pretzel vendors (for the overly-large pretzel and the chance to take a picture of her in all her pretzel-schlepping glory). We couldn't finish the pretzel either - it was gigantic (and salty), and after all the meat and gravy and beer, it was just too much.At some point during our lunch, the band came out to entertain us. It was fun to hear the traditional music, even though they seemed to play for two minutes and break for seven.I took a star from the rating because our waiter wasn't very friendly, or attentive. To us, at least. I mean - he took his time with the other tables, but left us mostly to our own devices.It was something my husband wanted to do, but after we left, he wasn't too keen on going back.

Over all wasn't impressed once we made it there. The food was decent the service was rough to say the least. It took us forever to find somewhere to sit. Eventually some folks left their table and we swooped in. We ended up sitting with their dirty dishes in front of us for around 20 minutes before the German couple who we were sharing a table with found someone to complain to them it was cleared away after some eye rolls and frustrated hand motions from our server. They are clearly understaffed. I received a beer fairly quickly but our food took a while. This may have again been due to our frustrated server because others around us got their food despite ordering after us. At some point a polka style band started to play. The music wasn't bad. After around an hour of waiting the food showed up. I wasn't overly impressed with it. We have had a lot of authentic Bavarian food on our trip here and this wasn't anything special. It was worth the trip for the novelty of going because I grew up drinking HB beer in frankenmuth, MI so it was cool to be at the old beirhaus.

It's a must for the experience if you don't drink beer.- Share a table and converse with complete strangers already drunk when some people are just enjoying coffee and be amused. - Go for the pretzels... massive, real tasty and more than enough to share with your drunk neighbors. - Lively band... man they know how to play and get the crown going. Food looks hearty and delish though we didn't order any. Non alcoholic drinks are also available","Oct 16, 2019",3.0

147,"What can you say about the biggest beer garden in the world?   Well, the place itself, with its atmosphere and history alone should be enough to get you to visit.   Only being in Munich for a week, it was something I had at the top of my list and I'm glad I took the opportunity to go.The place is definitely huge.  Floor after floor of tables, traditional German music, and plenty of beer flowing in enormous 1 litre mugs.  If I was reviewing on these things alone, I'd give it 5 stars.The food, however is where it could use a little improving.  I ordered what I figured would be the most traditional German, can't screw it up dish...wiener schnitzel.   It was fairly bland and tasteless, and it came with a tiny potato salad and cranberries (which were both good and I wish I had a bigger portion of that).   It wasn't bad, but just not overly impressive.Munich has some great restaurants, so I would recommend somewhere else for food, but 100% visit Hofbrauhaus for the beer and entertainment.","May 26, 2019",3.0

149,"This is a MUST DO even if you're in Munich for one day.  There's nothing else quite like the Hofbräuhaus experience. It's overwhelming in the best way filled with people drinking, talking and singing.  When you walk in you're faced with seemingly endless (and packed) tables of people. You need to just find a place to squeeze your group in.  Sometimes you'll find an empty table, other times it's time to make some friends.  Once you get a seat it's time to flag down your waiter to order a nice GIANT beer (or whatever your drink of choice is). I found the original to be delicious.  When it came to the food I wasn't overly impressed with the 1 bratwurst I received, considering I only got one, but it was pretty good. But I HIGHLY recommend getting one of those giant pretzels. They were soft and salty and honestly the best part of the meal.  Overall, it's not a place I'd visit regularly because it can feel hectic, but it's definitely an experience and I'd definitely go back if I came back to Munich.","Jul 16, 2019",4.0

That being said my suckling Pig with gravy and dumpling was fantastic, so tender with crunchy skin and the dumpling was springy gravy absorbing heaven! Of course all the beers we ordered were fantastic and not too filling very easy to drink!As to the noise, the place is huge, we just kept moving further away from the music until we could hear each other speak.

With that said I think I know why some people would give poor scores. If you are looking for a quiet place to have a conversation with your friends, this is not the place.

Apparently on the first Monday of the month bands come to play and people are welcomed to bring instruments and join in. This was the first night in 2 years that they were able to do so after Covid. We were sat upstairs and feeling bummed that we didn't get to sit with everyone one else on the first floor where the hustle and bustle was, but we had no clue we were about to have one of the best nights of our life. We sang, we danced, we ate, drank and made friends. The food was very good and should be considered the standard for Bavaria. We listened to the traditional bands and were lucky to be front and center to watch a world class violinist grace us with a performance that put the room into tears. What an amazing night!

We came in shortly after it opened for lunch and there was no one there but damn literally after 30 mins, you wouldn't be able to find a seat anywhere! The place is lit haha during the day and any time really. It's like you're in Oktoberfest even though it's not Oktoberfest so if you're looking for that kind of vibe, definitely come here!Our service was particularly not great because the waiter took FOREVER. But it's fine. It's Oktoberfest, I'll give them that. They give you German menus so make sure to ask for English ones if you don't read German lol. We got roast pork with potato balls and gravy and charcuterie. Both were delicious, I had better roast pork outside of Hofbrau in Germany so I would say it's so-so.

I can't count how many times our local friends told us in the days following to go for the drinks but avoid the food at all cost. Vegetarian options are limited and unappetizing. The sausages were so bad that we've renamed the place Hotdoghaus. A person I was traveling with, who has a reputation for being a dumpster and willing to eat anything with mustard on it, wouldn't even finish his meal. The pretzels and beer are phenomenal and the atmosphere can't be bought. Stick to the basic beer and pretzels, eat before you go, and have a night to remember.","Jan 3, 2019",3.0

I was excited to return on my trip to Munich this week. When I arrived midday I was greeted by a man checking for vaccinations. I showed him my US CDC paper vaccination record and was turned away because I did not have the 'required' QRS code provided to German residents, which as a tourist, is unattainable in Germany (I visited three pharmacies to ask). Each time I was told, that in order to convert paper records to electronic would require that I am a German resident. I asked the pharmacist if establishments required electronic records only and was told that they could indeed, accept paper. I recognize Covid rates are up in Germany but unless this is a company policy, this was unfair for someone to subjectively reject my paper documentation.  As all Americans know, there is no federal government electronic records for vaccination in the US. Anyway, highly disappointed and reduced a five star rating to three. They were happy to accept my US documentation in September when there was lots of money to make but not so much now. I shall burn my Hofsbrauhaus T Shirt when I return home!","Dec 2, 2021",3.0

Litre biers and tradition oom-pah music make this an insanely fun place especially for groups though it can be difficult to find a seat when it's really busy.

Lots of selfish people of two hogging tables of 6-8. Pretty awful service by international standards yet they continue to pull in the crowds. Waiting 20 minutes to be served your menu when the place is not mad packed might be a quaint custom but it's kinda antiquated and shouldn't be tolerated as a local custom. But if Bavarian wants to live in the past it can, it serves up good beer just I think there are more local breweries with just the authentic touch but without the hype.

We did turn it around on our waiter though and gave him a taste of his own medicine and started rushing him! He changed his tune real quick especially when we told him we would be saving a lot of money on the tip.

There is NO ventilation here! Keep this in mind. When you sit down there is no flow of air so be ready.

Because I can say I did it, but I don't know that I'd need to return.    ---   ---   ---Since Hofrauhaus opened a location in St. Pete, Florida, I feel like it tarnished my experience a bit at this original location. The location in my neck of the woods looks virtually identical, the OG is just larger.One thing I noticed right as we walked in - it smelled like a locker room. I'm not sure if that's the beer, the sausage or the sweaty people inside, but it wasn't the most pleasant aroma, and it was not a subtle smell - it really kicked us in the face as we entered. I definitely don't recommend visiting here if you're looking to have a conversation. It's super loud and it was tough for us to find a seat - definitely be prepared for the communal table situation. And the loudness was mostly due to the band playing nearby, not as much because the patrons were feeling particularly Oktoberfest-y. There was one table who would stand up and yell ""AYYYYY"" at certain points along with the band, but mostly everyone else was pretty subdued. I was trying to chat with the locals around us, but because it was so loud and because of the language barrier, my wife and I mostly found ourselves just kind of sitting and looking around instead of trying to communicate. She doesn't drink beer and we had just eaten, so I enjoyed one beer and we decided to head out. If you're in Munich, it's probably worth visiting once, especially if you've never been to a satellite location, but hopefully you'll be in a bit more of a party mood than we were on that night.","Sep 28, 2017",4.0

Manly men in Lederhosen rock the upstairs beer hall   with traditional German beer hall music while drunk off their ass patrons sing, scream, eat urinate and suck down unimaginable quantities of amber nectar.  Few experiences will bring you closet to heaven.  I even heard someone praying to a porcelain God in the men's room.Hofbrau Haus's Oktoberfest tent seats 9,991 pilgrims who do their part to consume the 7.5 million gallons of beer that are consumed during the 2+ week Oktoberfest period.

185,"Hofbräuhaus is one the places I've seen all over every major travel website on their to do list in Munich. Essentially I was under the impression that it was the ""orientation"" for foreigners. We told our German friends and knowing our enthusiasm, they set a reservation! However how busy, loud and generally lack of service in this place makes it feel disorganized. We sat in the outdoor patio area on the second floor. Heads up you're suppose to call or go online a week in advance if you want a reservation. On the day, we called to push back our reservation for 30mins later and fortunately they were nice about it. First, so much meat! Which is German staple to pair with beer. Which is fine, but my friend ordered a large mixed salad and it took them forever to serve it (nearly when the other four of us finished our meal), half hour later. The main entrees in your order will arrive fast in the matter of minutes, so will the beer, but not if you're trying to get something else. The white veal sausages with mustard also arrived half hour later. (side note: the white sausages are usually eaten without the skin. Heard it's because the skin is bad for digestion). We understand that the waiter was busy but the salad and prepared sausage is easily the simplest part of our order. We reminded the waiter three times because it seemed like he forgot about our order. The dark beer with lemonade was interesting and has the fizz of coca-cola. I like sweet foods so it was the interesting part of our meal. Overall I got to learn a lot about German cuisine from my German friends and we had a good time catching up. But we could have a easier time at another beer house in a less crowded location with better service.","Aug 4, 2018",3.0

There's a bunch of tables reserved, but everywhere else is open seating.  Even by myself, I had a hard time finding a place to rest.  After finding a spot, I ordered an original 1 L beer and started getting sloshed because it was the first meal of the day.  My neighbor tried the meatloaf and said it was like Spam without the zing.  He didn't finish it, of course I chose another pork knuckle experience.  HB made the most delicious knuckle I've had in Munich.  The skin was crisp and the meat was tender.  The potato dumpling was delectable.  I also ordered veal sausage, which came floating in a vessel of hot water.  Great experience.  My second visit, we sat down and waved for service, but to no avail.  We decided to walk up to the entrance and find a seat there where we were promptly taken care of.  -1 star for that piss poor start.  I don't know what happened this time.  Must be a bad chef back there because the skin on our knuckle was not crisp at all, which was disappointing to my +1.  We also had some yummy wieners with mustard too.  Overall, HB is one of those items to check off your touristy list.  Pick up some neat gifts at the shop while your there.","Sep 6, 2017",4.0
187,A place to go to check the block. Food was eh. A little overpriced and standard compared to the price and flavor at most of the mom and pop places around Munich. I would compare it to standard bar food in the states. Same things as most sit down restaurants but watered down in a sense. We lucked out with our group of 6 by getting there around 12 on a Saturday to beat the rush and did not have to wait. Beer is simple and good. Had the original and dunkle. They do have others like the radler and some seasonal choices. The beers come in 1 Ls so you won't have to get a refill often. This works as they are kind of slow at coming around to the tables. More of a place to sit around and have a beer with friends for the nostalgia purpose than the quality of food & beer/ price. I would go again if a new group wanted to go but would stick to other places that are less of a tourist destination.,"Jul 5, 2020",3.0

My fiancé and his buddy ordered a pretzel, which were extremely hard and stale. They said it was by far the worst pretzel they've ever had. I got the cheese spätzle and it was pretty awful too. Not sure if it had just been sitting out for a while since it was later in the night but it came out cold.Our waiter wasn't the friendliest with us at first (might have been a language barrier) but he eventually warmed up to us towards the end.

We returned here to try authentic Bavarian food, and we definitely got authentic European service. We were ignored by several waiters we tried to wave down several times until someone was kind enough to seat us. Once we sat, it took 20 minutes before a waiter even entered the room so we waved down the host. Once we got a server, though, he was very attentive. We started with the obazda cheese, I ordered the pork and dumpling, and my wife ordered the vegetable quiche.The cheese was soft and delicious and it had a unique taste. The pork was cooked well, but the sauce was flavorless and the dumpling was bland. The vegetable quiche had a good potion of vegetables inside with a salad on the side that had a light dressing. The pastry itself was not very flavorful. She ended up picking the vegetables out to avoid the rest.

We sat down and a waiter was very quick to come over and help us. He didn't speak much English but he was still really helpful. They have English menus which is nice. We all enjoyed our meals. The restaurant is also in a good location.,"Jun 24, 2021",5.0
194,The place to come for festivities! Visited here during the evening time and I would recommend eating outside as it was stuffy and felt like a sweaty sauna this place is huge and can pack a lot of people. The outside courtyard is also very big and has a second level with additional outdoor and indoor seating. I loved walking in and hearing the live band it really set the mood. The food and drinks here were great and the pretzel is not on their menu. There are some ladies that walk around selling them and you can purchase the pretzels from them.,"Nov 21, 2019",4.0
195,"This was a great experience for my study abroad group. We wandered around the Hofbräuhaus on a Friday night and it was wild. There were people everywhere having a great time. We have a large group so our reservation was on the third floor which was a massive dining hall. The service was good considering how many people were in the restaurant, but the food was nothing to get worked up about. We also got to hear the Umpa band right next to us and ""whip"" music a couple of times which was really loud, but fun to watch. This is a must visit in Munich.","Jan 5, 2020",5.0
196,"I was pretty excited in general to check out Hofbrauhaus. Finally getting over my jet lag and feeling like a normal person again, we entered after a full day wandering all over Munich. First thing is first, the checklist...Live music? Yep.Beer hall? Yep.Beer garden? Yep.Food? Yep.Beer by the liter? YAS.I have to say the food was just average in my opinion, but what they lack in food they make up for in ambiance. The live band was great. Some people dancing and just about everybody day drinking on a Sunday. Seating is self serve and I would definitely say it's quite the mix of locals and tourists. Also English menus at hand if needed and each of the servers seemed to understand English which made it easy for us to communicate. For food, I ordered the roast pork with crackling served with homemade natural gravy and a potato dumpling. I probably would've went with some sort of sausage or pork knuckle but I'd been ordering quite a few of those over the past few days so I thought I'd give the roast pork a try. While it was quite juicy and tender, easily would've preferred a pork knuckle or a sausage plate after a few bites. The potato dumpling, not sure what it is about it but just not a fan of potato dumplings in general.For beer, I did a liter of their dark beer. Surprisingly not as filling as one might think and I was able to put it down with no problem along with my food. Talk about crushable. Anyways, it was an enjoyable experience and definitely a must do when in Germany... visit a beer garden and have a liter of beer. Cross that off the bucket list.'Til next time, cheers!209/365","Aug 18, 2017",4.0

This iconic beer hall/restaurant carries so much history not only for Germany, but for Bavaria.Even though the hall is large, they do a pretty good job at serving you and making sure your liter of beer doesn't get empty. As with most halls, seating is family style which means you will make fast friends with your neighbors.I would recommend visiting during the weekday evenings to get the full effect (including the band) -- but still being able to find a seating (especially if you are traveling with a group of folks).","Nov 28, 2017",4.0

Hofbrauhaus is awesome.  Walking into Hofbrauhaus is stunning. It's huge. Massive. It's packed with people enjoying plentiful beer and the company of hundreds of other people. Bavarian music played by the  live band in the center of the room surrounds you. And so surprisingly beautiful. We were stunned by the vaulted, beautifully painted ceilings.It was Friday night, but we found seats at a long table shared with people from the UK, Ireland and Germany. Sharing beer with strangers is half the fun of a beer garden.  We ordered our big Hofbrau beers and settled in surrounded by great oom pa pa music and the roar of the crowd. It feels like Oktoberfest come to life every day.  Our waiter was great. SO MUCH FUN!  Hofbrauhaus is everything you didn't know you wished existed near your own house.

And the overall atmosphere was really nice.  I recommend making a reservation if you don't want to wait in line.  We went on a weekday.

203,"Definitely a place worth going to when in Munich. Hofbrauhaus is a fun beer hall that has tons of history attached to it, dating back to the 1500's! Can be a bit confusing at first when you first enter, but you can just go sit wherever there is an open bench seat and a server will come up to you to take your drink order and then food order if you also want to eat. Their original (lager) beer was pretty good. We got the Roast Pork Belly dish and their Weiner Schnitzel and they were both pretty good as well. The best? Probably not. You come to Hofbrauhaus for the experience, definitely not for the food. Super touristy but you'll have some crazy fun here!","Sep 10, 2019",5.0

FOOD: After finding a table nestled in the corner, we decided to start our evening by enjoying a stein of beer and a basket of warm pretzles. So delicious!! And with so many entree options, my husband and I had a hard time deciding what to order! We finally decided to try the Wienerschnitzel and Bavarian Roast Chicken. Both served with potato salad and cranberries, we were set! The meat was tender and flavored perfectly.  SERVICE: Our server was attentive, fun and outgoing. Not to mention, all the waitresses carrying 8-10 steins filled with beer around to the tables was impressive! SPACE/ATMOSPHERE: The space is huge!! With multiple halls and rooms, I was amazed with how massive the space was! The atmosphere was upbeat and fun. With a live band playing Bavarian music, and the ceiling painted with beautiful murals, the space comes to life and the vibe is energetic and fun.

When you enter you likely won't find a hostess or server to seat you. We just sort of followed some guys in and sat at an open table. They have long tables that encourage social interaction with strangers which I think is fun. The service was sort of slow, not very friendly but that is ok too. We were mainly here for the experience and people watching. A gal will come around with giant pretzels or other yummy carb goodies for 2€. Right before we left a band was starting to play.

I can't believe something like this is happening in 2023, this wouldn't even happen in the remotest of mid-west small towns in the US. One thing this place had going for them was fortunately the beer. We tried the hofrbräu original and it was decent. But the experience overall was garbage.

The beer was great but I forgot the ""big"" volume of it in the glass.

There is a big indoor area as well as an outdoor area... and it was full! Definitely a fun place to check out if you're visiting Munich. I'm not much of a beer drinker (I know, I know) but I somehow managed to make nearly 1 liter of the drinkable Hofbrau Original disappear. For food I ordered a side of sauerkraut and a side of spaetzle (vegetarian over here, hi). Several minutes later our waiter returned and said the spaetzle was ""out of order."" Damn it. Okay on to Plan B, the homemade vegetable pie ""garnished"" with salad it was. But oops I forgot that I had ordered the sauerkraut. So. Much. Food. I was expecting the vegetable pie to be like a pot pie of sorts but it ended up being kind of like a rectangle of mixed veggie, cheesy, eggy quiche with a borderline soggy crust. Unfortunately it wasn't hot hot (temp) but it was still satisfying. The green salad was a nice fresh note. The sauerkraut was served hot (for some reason I was expecting cold kraut) but it was super flavorful and I enjoyed it enough.Our waiter wasn't great, but I personally would rather be a plumber than attempt to deal with the chaos of Hofbrauhaus, so no real complaints. Oh, and my arms are definitely not strong enough to carry all of those ginormous beers. Prices are decent, but definitely not cheap.Overall, I'd say check it out once with a group of friends and you'll probably have a good experience overall.","Jun 6, 2017",4.0

They have a live band at night playing exotic German music in lederhosen, 1 litre steins of beer and giant pretzels that are truly delicious.   There is no bar at this place.   You get a long table and you sit with strangers if you are by yourself or in a small group.  But most people here are friendly.  The servers know how to direct you through their menu if you have never been there and are good at answering your questions.   US dollars are accepted at this bar!   I tried their homemade wieners and they were decent.  Their sauerkraut was very good.   It's better to share some of the food at your table, even if it is with strangers because that pretzel is a lot to eat by yourself.   Literally it is the size of your head almost.

First of all, you walk through these massive doors and you enter into this hall that initially doesn't seem to be that big. But once you keep walking you realize that it keeps on going! There are so many halls attached to the main hall and the main hall has a German band playing traditional German music! Also, it's PACKED. Even when we got in at like 5pm it was already completely full in the main hall so we had to sit in one of the side halls.Everybody is a bit tipsy and there are a ton of tourists, but overall it's a good time. There are a ton of servers here too and they're really quick in bringing out the foods and drinks. They were super friendly, helped explain things and were very patient even though you can tell they were super busy, so I really appreciate that!They have a huge menu - so many options. We came here and got their infamous 1L beers. I had the dark beer and it did taste interesting and was good but didn't blow my mind. Even though I've never had German dark beer before I knew that there must be better places from what people described. The food here was sort of mediocre too, we had the classic dishes: bratwurst and sauerkraut, pork knuckle, pork belly and potato dumplings. The pork knuckle was really hard to eat, and wasn't cooked perfectly. The other foods were a bit better but still didn't have that much flavor or freshness. We got the pretzels and it was tough and tasted stale. We also had dessert and this was pretty tasty though! The Kaiserschmarrn (fried donut) was pretty good though!Overall, it was a good experience, but I probably wouldn't go back.

Once you do, it's kind of hard to grasp: the Hofbräuhaus is absolutely immense. The main hall alone seats over 1300, with many more occupying the other rooms and the sizeable beer garden. You can (and I did) spend a good twenty minutes just searching for a place to sit if you come during Oktoberfest. I found a relatively quiet bench inside and got my order in: the wursteller (a kind of sausage sample plate) and a half litre of dunkel (a dark lager). The gruff waiter took my order and the food came out surprisingly quick. Unfortunately, it was just so-so. That plate came with two small pieces of Vienna sausage (think a natural casing hotdog with a bit more bite to it), a piece of long, coarsely ground spicy pork sausage, and a thicker, finer pork sausage, all on a heap of sauerkraut.

We hung out with then for almost an hour. They're married, but their wives insist they have some man time with each other, to keep the Bromance going. Every Thursday afternoon they ride their bikes here, chat, meet new people, listen to some music, drink a couple liters, and then ride their bikes back home(about 4km) in time for dinner. We talked about life, politics, friendships, travel, philosophy...I love meeting locals, its one of my favorite parts about travel!

241,"This was exceptional. We had a idea what to expect, crowds, but this was almost overwhelming. You sit with random people you will never see againAnd have a sparkling little talk over huge one liter beers and sausages and sauerkraut. Don t forget the bread basket..and the Goulash is superior if you ask for boiled potatoes instead of a dumpling.. Our table mates were from Moscow Russia. And here we are in the beer house that Hitler chose to launch the Nazi party. And 200 tables are original. Wow what a place. What a decor.what atmosphere.And the band played on...Thanks  google translate.","Oct 29, 2018",5.0
242,"Our group of 13 was able to find seating and a couple different tables, and that's showing up at 5pm on a Thursday night. We all settled in for our cold plates, hot plates, and pork knuckle. I went with the knuckle, which isn't as good as it comes in Munich, but was certainly more than edible. Would I go back next time I visit Munich? No, I wouldn't - but staff were friendly enough, especially considering they have to spend their days serving annoying, drunk tourists. :)","Dec 19, 2016",3.0
243,"This would be one of the most memorable things I did in Munich. Considered as the best beer hall in the world, you would see a lot of tourist flocking and dining. Women wearing dirndl whil men wearing lederhosen made you transport to oktoberfest.Scrolling through all the reviews here, a lot of people mentioned that they were not catered for a very long time, most of the reasons point out that there's no designated person to serve them. It wasn't the case for us, it might be because we went there after lunch time. We were immediately served and we were well looked after. We understood that with the amount of people, we would be probably wait longer just to be served but we were very committed to trying the dishes of Hofbrauhaus especially its famous pints so no matter the circumstances, we will wait patiently. Funny thing is I was also doing my grad school course requirement while waiting so it doesn't bother me as muchJust be patient if you really want to experience the beer hall. Remember it's a tourist spot, a lot of people all over the world would come and dine in.","Mar 25, 2019",5.0

245,"I really enjoyed my experience here.While there are no shortage of famous beer halls in Munich, this place is one of the ""must-see's"" for a variety of reasons.  Reputation aside, the Hofbrauhaus is a Munich institution featuring cavernous digs full of communal seating, loud patrons and huge servings of beer and local German favorites.Basically if you're in the mood to get the whole beer house experience, you can't go wrong here.  I wouldn't say the food blew my mind but some of the sausages were definitely very tasty.  The pretzel here was gigantic and the huge servings of beer will definitely put you in a good (and bloated) state in a short period of time.  This place is often packed to the brim and it can definitely feel touristy at times.  But one can't deny how much fun it is to be here, eating the food, soaking in the fun ambiance and drinking some kick ass Hofbrau lager.  During my time in Munich, the Hofbrauhaus was definitely one of the most memorable aspects of my trip.  While I'll definitely hit up more beer houses on my next trip, I will most certainly come back here again as well!","May 6, 2016",5.0
246,"Busy place and definitely touristy.  Fun stop just to say you have been here but does not feel like a chill traditional Bavarian beer hall, because of all the people rushing around and lines of people and tour guides walking through the Schwemmel.  We enjoyed ourselves drinking the half liters of Dunkel and  original beer.  The pork sausage links with sauerkraut was good and my son ordered a jhang roasted chicken was good, but the potato salad was just ok.  Great place to take in the history, and get loud, but not a place to sit back and relax to enjoy a beer with food.","Jan 2, 2019",3.0
247,"This place is obviously a tourist trap, but who cares?  This is like a cathedral for wonderful beer.  The service was great, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming, and the food was fantastic.

248,"It's our first time in Munich and I feel this is a must/do when in town. The atmosphere is lively, there's live music even at 4pm. Service is so-so, some servers are timid and refuse to engage I think due to language barrier. Beer is 8 euro and main dishes start at 12 euro up. We enjoyed the vibe, the people-watching and we welcomed the slow service as it was a good break for our tired feet. It is a German Hard Rock Cafe with merchandise of all kinds bearing the name. Free use of toilets too which is getting rare in Europe.","Oct 18, 2018",5.0

250,Go do the tourist thing and have yourself a beer and make new friends.  First of all it's a free-for-all. Find a place to sit as no one will escort you to a table.  If you are already sitting at a table move over and make room for others so it's not so awkward. Once seated it does take a while for the waitress to get your order.  I recommend ordering food and drink all at once especially if it's busy.  I knocked a star off because we waited 40 minutes to order just beer and all the food was all sold out.,"Jan 6, 2019",4.0
251,"It is a bit cliched, but it has to be experienced. Hofbrauhaus is steps away from Marienplatz, so it is very convenient to work into a walking tour of the city center. The place is huge, with giant beer hall style seating downstairs, a giant outdoor patio, and more space upstairs for special occasions. We came late on a chilly Friday night and enjoyed a beer and giant pretzel on the patio. They come in liter size only, and the dunkel was our preference. It went down smooth with the pretzel, which is served by a pretzel maid who walks around with a basket full of the good stuff. We also ordered obazda from the waiter, which is tasty cheese that comes with its own slice of rye bread, but it was much better slathered on the pretzel.Even better, they had a band playing traditional tunes, which set a great scene. Hard to imagine people have been enjoying this place for nearly 500 years, so do yourself a favor and join mankind's unbroken beer lineage.","Sep 5, 2018",4.0
252,"The international Hofbrauhaus (HB) in Munich is a lot fun with music and dancing. It is located in the heart of the City of Munich. I would say make reservations to dinner show is the best to experience this wonderful germ. This is Bavarian region food. It is a lot of different than many Germany cities food. Be ready of your stomach because you are going to ride out the food and beer at this place with wonderful celebration night. The beer here is awesome and fresh since the brewery is next to it. I like their Hofbrau Original beer has a very great taste of it. The food include roast pork with cracklings, roasted pork knuckles, sausages and more. The entertainment is very fun with audience participation. I like the ribbon dance. One wrong move or step, the ribbon will not wrap the pole with correct pattern. Wood chopping with their wood chip flying to our table. The show also present the cow bell music with hand eyes coordination. Overall I recommend you book this event 1 week earlier before you come. It is fun to drink at their beer garden and eat at their restaurant.","Jan 28, 2016",5.0
253,"Oh the famous Hofbrauhaus, everyone talks about, visits it, and either runs at the first sight of the large crowds or joins in on the fun. I decided to take the journey and experience an old cultural experience that has slowly vanished these days in Germany. So to cut to the chase, yes expect a TON of people and sometimes a long wait. I honestly walked in, circled a few times and found a seat outside as inside was nearly impossible to find a seat. As with many German restaurants, no dilly dallying allowed when it comes to ordering. Menus were on the table (English included), and it was pretty straight forward in terms of what to expect. I of course did my due diligence and looked ahead of time, but I was already suck on the baked pig knuckle. My travel partner ended up getting a sampler plate of sausages and sauerkraut. Flagged a server who could care less about friendliness, but honestly I'd be worn out with the crowds at this famous restaurant as well.  Put in our order with a couple of beers and of course purchased a giant pretzel from one of the many employees walking around with a large baskets of pretzels. Food and beer came out pretty quickly, which had me a tad skeptical in terms of food delivery, but that was quickly shot down with I sunk my teeth into the fred flinstone sized pig knuckle. Extremely tender, crunchy skin, wonderful sauce and over all a complete mouth-gasm. I wish I could consume them daily, but I am pretty sure the flight cost to Munich would bankrupt me after awhile! My travel partner had some tasty sausage, but the sauerkraut was the real winner honestly, very tasty with a nice touch of caraway seeds to add some punch. As for pricing, yes it is not a cheap eat, but an authentic German feast, and I would gladly do it again in a heartbeat!","Dec 3, 2017",4.0
254,"Been here a lot, typically with people who have never been to Munich before. If you have never been, you must go, primarily because everyone will swear that you must stop there, but one trip will last a lifetime.While this is one of the more iconic spots in Munich, it has become more of a tourist attraction than a place to eat and drink. They push the larger beers (Maß), instead of the smaller half liters; my guess is that because of the crowds and how busy it typically is, this prevents them from having to come to the tables as often. The food is mediocre; my advice is that if you are hungry, eat somewhere else and just come here for a bier.I found the schnitzel to be uninspiring and the schweinhaxe was overpriced for what you got. Clearly there are better meals to be had in Munich, but as a tourist attraction, put it on your list. Most evenings will also have live music but never too loud that it drowns out conversations.The tables are community tables, like ever beer hall in Germany, but when you sit at these tables you are rarely sitting with Germans, you are most likely sitting with people from other countries as well, so if you want to talk to Germans about German things, you'll be out of luck. But you will have an opportunity to find out more about Spain, Greece or other countries from the folks around you.","Jan 31, 2020",2.0
255,"So this place seemed very disorganized. There's no system to getting seated, you just have to kind of walk around the really busy restaurant, watching the tales like a hawk to swoop in when someone gets up. It's pretty awkward, because you don't want to make people feel like you're rushing them. They need a waiting list or a host at least. The food was good, the nonvegan menu items looked really good and the big pretzels were expensive but tasty. They had no vegan menu items besides a side salad. I asked if the side of salted potatoes had butter on them, and my server replied ""I think so"" so, not a good sign. Small-ish glasses of water were €2,90 (Over 3 US dollars) ...Overall, I guess it was worth the experience because it's a really famous place.","Jan 2, 2019",3.0
256,"Probably the best known beer hall in Munich.   Stopped in during my visit during Oktoberfest.  Joined a large group at a long table on the 3rd floor not far from the band on stage.  Sampled my 1st pork knuckle and potato dumplings which were salty and good with the dark beer that I was drinking.  As many have stated, the food wasn't 5-star, but it was fulfilling while drinking copious amounts of beer.  Servers were busy, but friendly enough, and attentive.  Prices were reasonable.

263,"Five stars to HB for hanging around Munich since the late 1500s, surviving several wars, host several historical figures, serve traditional German food and know how to throw a party nightly for people around the world. If you have read a few of my reviews, you know that I just don't go somewhere to say I've been there and take a photo for social media. I like to find out more about a place, HB is no exception. To spare you a long History lesson about the place, I urge you to google the History of HB and appreciate it just not as a place to eat, have a bier and take pictures. From being the Royal bier and bier house of the Bavarian King when it opened to hosting figures as Lenin, Hiltler and Motzart, there is more than being a tourist trap in today's world. So I came here during Oktoberfest of this year, yes I'm a sucker for punishment. Full and packed, I knew we had to act fast to secure a table. We split up and I scored a table, texted my friend, flagged down my waitress and ordered. I knew I could be a lookie-loo after. Work smarter not harder!The food came quick and we ordered the sausage plate with spätzle to share. It's German food. I've had this dish a few times at the HB in Vegas plus other places in my trip. Now, I do have to say the pretzel was better than the ones in Vegas... Yes I know it's not as Fresh, duh. Bier was good.The people watching is fantastic here, ranks up there after Vegas on a Saturday night in July. The poor pretzel gals, they were always being lassoed into tourist pictures, so purchase a pretzel as she passes your table. If you have been to America's HBs, let me say this: This. Is. Germany. You aren't going to chicken dance, group sing ""Caroline"" or get paddled after a shot by your server in a drind'l. So yes, please go. Have a bier and Google the history.","Dec 10, 2015",5.0

Maybe it's different during lunch hours as dinner might be a little more hectic. This place is huge with multiple levels. Thank goodness we got to sit inside with heat. It was very relaxing. We of course got German beer again to try. I'm not much of a beer drinker so I don't have much to comment about it but it was definitely decent. One of the better beers I have enjoyed. I got the roasted pork knuckle and it was much better than the other beer garden. Skin was very crispy and seasoned very well. Their potato ball was also better tasting as it had more flavor. I also got to try the pickled pork knuckle which the other beer garden didn't seem to offer. It was also very good and actually more tender. I'd gladly get both if I come here again. I also tried to buy a beer glass here as well and the lovely staff told us to just go to the gift shop to buy it so it's guaranteed to be new and I can inspect and choose the glass I want myself. My other friend tried the ox roast and it was pretty dry and not tender. Try to not be so adventurous and stick to what foods should taste good and be relatively foolproof to cook.

Instead we set out on foot to the Hofbrauhaus after wandering the city. We wandered the restaurant for about 5 minutes when a 4 person table opened up and our three large butts plopped down.  We waited maybe another 2 minutes before menus were slid into our chubby hands and maybe another 15 minutes passed when we decided what we wanted. What can I say? Our brains were still bogged down with travel itineraries and other miscellaneous American pointlessness. Some more time goes by and then our XL radlers are placed in our still chubby hands and here is where I leave my mortal body and ascend into heaven.  Slightly sweet, incredibly refreshing, and that aura of beer enters my bloodstream and my California brain forgets about the snow outside (that's right, it snowed). Then a super hot woman in traditional Oktoberfest gear saunters up to our table with two XXL pretzels and I reach spiritual nirvana. I black out and somehow buy a pretzel from her. She only accepts cash, I DGAF. Our meals are float to us and here is what I remember of my spaetzle: it's one of their few vegetarian options, it's cheesy and delicious, and it's topped with fried onions. It goes amazingly with my radler and I can't imagine ever being hungry again. I snagged my chub-hub's sauerkraut cuz he hates it, I love it.

Next thing you know you're looking for, finding a table and a waitress who reminded me of someone from the movie Heidi, is passing out a round of beer in giant mugs.  I'm sitting with my traveling companions, a colonel and major when someone comes over and tells the major that the table we're sitting at is one of the family tables. I look around and now I notice some of these table booths have what I figure are family crests over them and maybe at certain times, like these busy nights, they're reserved for local families. Probably for years.The major leans over and tells the colonel about it suggest that we move.  But the colonel isn't having any of that. He's enjoying his beer, smiling and listening to the music while he looks over the menu.  We're getting some strange looks from a couple of folk at the nearby tables and I'm thinking, oh Lord this colonel's about to start an international incident.  But as it turns out when some of the family members DO show up, they wanted us to stay and it turned into a good time with good company and good food.  The music was playing, people were singing, beer mugs were hitting against the table, the pork and pretzels was coming out.  It was freezing outside but it was nice and warm where we were sitting.  Beer is in important and historic food group in Germany and there was plenty to be had.   When we were finished, got up and walked around, that's when we noticed that there was an even larger dinner hall room where the majority of the tourist were seated.  The major looked at me and said that's probably where we were supposed to be!  I mean the place was packed! If you ever get to Germany you have to make a stop here and order up some cheer.","Mar 2, 2015",5.0
293,"If you like beer, Hofbrauhaus is a must visit. The seating is unique, and unlike most places in the US, so it encourages you meeting neighbors, which brings you together with people from all over the world- especially after a few of the big mug beers! Or, go out back and enjoy your beeer on the patio overlooking a square. Amazing history to this venue and a story to be told at every corner. Highly recommend giving this place a try.","Sep 20, 2019",5.0
294,"Awesome place! Love the beer and food. The environment is lively, fun, and loud. Seating is a bit different. Find a spot or ask people if you can sit with them. We met a nice couple who help us with the beer and food...gave us really good suggestions because they had been there before. The band plays often. There's not a limit on how long you can sit there but you do have to order food or drinks. Again love this place","Jun 12, 2017",5.0
295,"Come here for the experience, not the food. This is a massive temple to German beer. I didn't see the whole place but there are multiple floors and so many different dining rooms.... it's pretty spectacular. Everyone is drinking beer and having a good time. They didn't let me order any increments smaller than a liter of beer.","Aug 19, 2019",3.0
296,"5 STAR FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!Hofbrauhaus:  U-L-T-I-M-A-T-E REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!First things first, know your history.The Hofbräuhaus am Platzl, Munich's famous ""hofbrauhaus"", was founded in 1589 by the Duke of Bavaria, Wilhelm V.  It is one of Munich's oldest beer halls.  It was founded as the brewery to the old Royal Residence, which at that time was situated just around the corner from where the beer hall stands today.Even the Royals wanted to live near the Hofbrauhaus, which is why I booked my hotel during my nearly two week stay in Munich to be as close to the Hofbrauhaus as possible.Additional history:  Some little Austrian used to speak here too, I think he killed himself, or moved to Argentina, anyways.This is the place to meet friends, family, even enjoy by yourself.  Some of people's biggest complaints are also it's most powerful strong points, The Hofbrauhaus is Munich's cultural center, therefore, many people, including locals and tourists are here at pretty much all times.For someone as social as me, I absolutely LOVE IT that it's packed and full of new people to chat with and look at.People from all over the world come here, so it's pretty much an international embassy.Also, and let's not gloss over this fact, the food and beer are some of the best you are ever to enjoy on your time on this Planet.  I wouldn't be surprised if many people's parting thoughts from this mortal coil are of good times at The Hofbrauhaus.But I digress, and in addition, would love to mention the amazingly talented oompah band!!!On one of my visits, they set up right next to my table in the outdoor courtyard, and I had the pleasure of listening to them live for an hour straight.Can you say HEAVEN!!!God, this place is one of a kind, so genuine, and the staff is super on point as well, especially given how many people they are waiting on at once.  The service has blown my mind given all the variables.  These people are extremely intelligent, on point, and well organized and managed.THE BEER, THE BEER, THE BEER!!!Order it, and keep it coming, this is not a place to come to for one drink, although many people do, and there is nothing wrong with that, but I have found that just posting up for 3 or 4 straight hours, over 3 or 4 liters is the way to go.Before you know it, you're all charged up, feeling great, and ready to take on the rest of Munich, or a nap!!!Either way, whether it's for one beer, or a bunch, or a plate of amazing food, The Hofbrauhaus is a life changing experience, and most of the humans who have entered it's doors, have remembered it for the rest of their lives.Thank you Hofbrauhaus, for existing, for loving me, and for allowing me to love you.I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!","Sep 5, 2017",5.0
297,"Yeah, I know that this place is an institution, and I know that I am only going on my first impressions from a few years back, and I also know that this place literally defines Munich, but honestly, I really didn't like it. I guess it really had a lot to do with the fact that it was just so crowded and I really couldn't get the attention of any of the wait staff, and I certainly had no idea where I could go and get one of those massive beers that they seem to advertise about this place. Okay, I'd probably only come here for a beer considering that there is absolutely no way I could actually eat one of their massive meals. Sure, I probably should give this place another shot, if I ever end up back in Munich that is, and I probably should update my review if that happens, at the way it is now, it was crowded, and I really had no idea how long I was going to wait until I actually got served.","Jun 19, 2019",2.0

299,"The whole roasted pork was very nice comparing with those I had tried. Dark beer was fresh so that you do not really taste the alcohol in, which made it really good with your foods. Also, the price was very reasonable. We ordered two dark beer, 1.01L, two pork, and one cheese noodle, and the total was €62.80. If you want to go to the dinning room instead of the beer house, you should call and make a reservation. I would recommend to go earlier since you will need to wait for a long time to have your foods come.","Dec 25, 2017",5.0
300,"Good beer, good food, terrible service. The server must have hated his job. Everything landed on our table with a loud thud. If you're going go work at a place with many tourists, you need a better disposition. We still tipped as if we had decent service, although we considered otherwise.  If you're willing to take a chance on service, go to this place simply for thr beer and atmosphere.","Jul 28, 2021",3.0
301,"We really liked this place! It's an institution, for sure. We felt like we couldn't very well come to Munich and not have a beer here, so we set out mid afternoon one day. It is HUGE - very cavernous place with tons of rooms, and it's very loud and a bit chaotic. It's important to note that when you walk in, you do not need to wait for/locate a hostess to be seated - you literally find a free seat somewhere and wedge your body into it. Service comes around when they can, and if there are a lot of people (which, let's face it, I'm unsure if this restaurant is ever NOT busy), it will take a little while - but try to be patient, if you can! The beer is worth it. Our waiter came around after waiting about 20 minutes - we watched him work in a clockwise fashion around what we deemed to be ""his"" service area, so I promise - they DO have a method, and they aren't ignoring you. We ordered two dark beers and some cheese spatzle to share. One of the nice things about a more touristy restaurant - he didn't bat an eye about us sharing. I have a pretty small appetite, especially when paired with a liter of beer, so we were appreciative of being able to split, which isn't usually a big thing in Europe. Will definitely be a repeat visit for us! Prost!","Nov 1, 2017",5.0
